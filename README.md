# Running C++ program on AWS Lambda (as Node modules)
<br/>
Set of various sample programs that imports a custom node module compiled from C++ code. This repo contains sample progs like just printing out a value after taking it as an event argument and couple of progs that takes multiple arguments (string or int) and returning a value.
<br/>
README files exist under each folder to see the exact functionality in detail.
